        <h2>About Me</h2>
        <p>Hi! My name is Arushi, and I’ve been passionate about tennis since I was 7 years old. Growing up, I spent countless hours practicing my strokes, refining my serve, and developing my game. Tennis has been more than just a sport for me – it’s a way of life. Over the years, I’ve played competitively in various tournaments and leagues, always striving to improve and push my limits. The thrill of a good rally, the challenge of facing strong opponents, and the sense of accomplishment after a hard-fought match are just some of the reasons why tennis remains such an important part of my life. Whether it's playing with friends or participating in local tournaments, I enjoy every moment on the court. Tennis has taught me valuable life skills such as discipline, perseverance, and mental strength. It has shaped who I am today and continues to inspire me to work harder every day.</p>
